    <h2>In The Beginning...</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, world!  My name is Andrew Schultz, usually known as Andy.  It
      always seems like it has been a very long time since writing whenever I
      get the chance to do some writing again.  This has especially been the
      case since transferring to Illinois Tech and diving into classes for my
      major.  Speaking of which, I'm in the 4th year of my Bachelors degree in
      Computer Science.  I started at Wilbur Wright Community College on the
      Northside of Chicago, then transferred to IIT after my 2nd year.  The
      commute has been rough, but that's one reason why I've looked into online
      classes!

    <h2>Why This Webpage Exists</h2>
    <p>
      My ambition for this class is quite straightforward.  Design a webpage
      for myself that does a couple of things.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Works (well)</li>
      <li>Looks like it was actually designed in 2020</li>
      <li>Showcases a worthy project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of those bulletpoints can be explained further, so here we go.
      In my last year of high school, I took a class called Web-Page Design.
      It was pretty basic and I did well in it.  That, along with another very
      basic programming class in high school were what sparked my interest
      in Computer Science.  So I spent the next 2 years doing math problems
      (since Wright only had 2 classes that would transfer into my major) and
      occasionally hearing about a computer.  Then I started Computer Science
      classes and realized that I still don't have a website.  Here I am.
